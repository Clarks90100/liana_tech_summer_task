Here is the assignement, based on the .psd file that was given.
As I couldn't get the exact size and specs of each element and detail of the design, I created it by just the eye.
I also took the liberty to modify the color codes and some other elements to fit the current brand guideline of Liana Technologies.
I mostly used Flexbox, and some elements from Bootstraps (buttons, dropdown menu, navigation bar).

Completing the task took me about 2 working days, and was quite nice to make.
As for the extra points, I completed the following:
* Main image with parallax
* Clients, employess and Users sections with animated numbers

I don't think I encountered big challenges, probably the main thing was that I didn't have the specs of the elements (as mentioned previously)
so the design doesn't look perfectly the same.

There are few things that I did a certain way that can most probably be optimized (inserting the images on the three cards
(Company, Support & contact Us), for example - this might have a been a half-challenge in that sense.
